# Predictive Model for Drinking Water Quality
_March 2023_

This report documents the process of preparing and exploring a dataset containing drinking water quality metrics for the purpose of building a preditive model for the drinkability of water.

Data used for exploratory data analysis and for model building is included in the data folder.

The script to build the best performing and most stable model is included as a .py file.

The process was carried out as follows:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis of the dataset with Tableau and Python, to understand the correlation between predictor and target variables
- Carried out methods of feature selection to create groups of feature sets to use in model building
- Built models to predict water quality using a basis of logistic regression models with techniques such as variable scaling and stacking
- Performed cross-fold validation on models to score and identify the top-performing model based on stability and performance across folds
- Presented all exploration and analysis in a report, including the Python script used to build the final model
